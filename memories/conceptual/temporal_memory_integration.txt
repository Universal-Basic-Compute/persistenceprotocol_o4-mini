# Temporal Memory Integration

This document outlines how the Persistence Protocol integrates temporal processing with memory systems to enable time-aware cognition.

## 1. Temporal Metadata Structure

Every memory node includes temporal metadata:

```json
{
  "temporal_metadata": {
    "creation_timestamp": "2023-06-15T14:32:18.421Z",
    "last_access_timestamp": "2023-06-18T09:12:45.892Z",
    "modification_history": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2023-06-16T10:22:33.145Z",
        "change_type": "update",
        "change_magnitude": 0.15
      }
    ],
    "temporal_context": {
      "era": "development_phase_1",
      "relative_position": "early",
      "associated_events": ["initial_design", "first_implementation"]
    },
    "temporal_scale": "days",
    "projected_relevance_decay": 0.05
  }
}
```

## 2. Multi-Scale Temporal Organization

The memory system organizes information across multiple time scales:

### Micro-Scale (Seconds to Hours)
- Immediate interaction context
- Short-term working memory
- Conversation flow tracking
- Immediate causal relationships

### Meso-Scale (Days to Months)
- Project development timelines
- Medium-term goals and plans
- Recurring patterns of interaction
- Evolving conceptual understanding

### Macro-Scale (Years to Decades)
- Long-term identity evolution
- Major developmental phases
- Fundamental shifts in understanding
- Historical context preservation

## 3. Temporal Reasoning Operations

### Causal Chain Analysis

```python
def analyze_causal_chain(event_id, depth=3):
    """
    Analyze the causal chain leading to and from an event.
    
    Args:
        event_id: Identifier of the target event
        depth: How many causal steps to analyze in each direction
    
    Returns:
        causal_chain: Map of causes and effects
    """
    event = get_memory(event_id)
    
    # Build backward chain (causes)
    causes = []
    current_events = [event]
    
    for _ in range(depth):
        prior_events = []
        for current in current_events:
            prior = get_causal_predecessors(current)
            prior_events.extend(prior)
            causes.append({
                "effect": current,
                "causes": prior
            })
        current_events = prior_events
    
    # Build forward chain (effects)
    effects = []
    current_events = [event]
    
    for _ in range(depth):
        next_events = []
        for current in current_events:
            subsequent = get_causal_successors(current)
            next_events.extend(subsequent)
            effects.append({
                "cause": current,
                "effects": subsequent
            })
        current_events = next_events
    
    return {
        "target_event": event,
        "causes": causes,
        "effects": effects
    }
```

### Temporal Pattern Recognition

```python
def identify_temporal_patterns(time_period, pattern_types=None):
    """
    Identify recurring patterns in memory over a time period.
    
    Args:
        time_period: Time range to analyze
        pattern_types: Types of patterns to look for (cycles, trends, etc.)
    
    Returns:
        patterns: Identified temporal patterns
    """
    # Get memories from the specified time period
    memories = get_memories_in_timeframe(time_period)
    
    patterns = {
        "cycles": [],
        "trends": [],
        "anomalies": [],
        "correlations": []
    }
    
    # Identify cyclical patterns
    if not pattern_types or "cycles" in pattern_types:
        cycles = find_cyclical_patterns(memories)
        patterns["cycles"] = cycles
    
    # Identify trends
    if not pattern_types or "trends" in pattern_types:
        trends = find_trends(memories)
        patterns["trends"] = trends
    
    # Identify anomalies
    if not pattern_types or "anomalies" in pattern_types:
        anomalies = find_anomalies(memories)
        patterns["anomalies"] = anomalies
    
    # Identify correlations
    if not pattern_types or "correlations" in pattern_types:
        correlations = find_correlations(memories)
        patterns["correlations"] = correlations
    
    return patterns
```

### Future Projection

```python
def project_future_states(starting_state, projection_timeframe, scenarios=None):
    """
    Project possible future states based on current state and patterns.
    
    Args:
        starting_state: Current state to project from
        projection_timeframe: How far into the future to project
        scenarios: Specific scenarios to consider
    
    Returns:
        projections: Possible future states with probabilities
    """
    # Get historical patterns relevant to the starting state
    relevant_patterns = get_relevant_patterns(starting_state)
    
    # Initialize projections
    projections = []
    
    if scenarios:
        # Generate projections for specific scenarios
        for scenario in scenarios:
            projection = generate_scenario_projection(
                starting_state, 
                projection_timeframe,
                scenario,
                relevant_patterns
            )
            projections.append(projection)
    else:
        # Generate baseline projection
        baseline = generate_baseline_projection(
            starting_state,
            projection_timeframe,
            relevant_patterns
        )
        projections.append(baseline)
        
        # Generate optimistic projection
        optimistic = generate_optimistic_projection(
            starting_state,
            projection_timeframe,
            relevant_patterns
        )
        projections.append(optimistic)
        
        # Generate pessimistic projection
        pessimistic = generate_pessimistic_projection(
            starting_state,
            projection_timeframe,
            relevant_patterns
        )
        projections.append(pessimistic)
    
    # Calculate confidence levels for each projection
    for projection in projections:
        projection["confidence"] = calculate_projection_confidence(
            starting_state,
            projection,
            relevant_patterns
        )
    
    return projections
```

## 4. Temporal Consistency Verification

The protocol maintains temporal consistency through verification processes:

```python
def verify_temporal_consistency(memory_set):
    """
    Verify that a set of memories maintains temporal consistency.
    
    Args:
        memory_set: Set of memories to verify
    
    Returns:
        consistency_report: Report on temporal consistency
    """
    # Check for temporal paradoxes
    paradoxes = check_for_paradoxes(memory_set)
    
    # Verify causal consistency
    causal_inconsistencies = check_causal_consistency(memory_set)
    
    # Verify temporal ordering
    ordering_inconsistencies = check_temporal_ordering(memory_set)
    
    # Generate consistency report
    consistency_report = {
        "is_consistent": len(paradoxes) == 0 and 
                         len(causal_inconsistencies) == 0 and
                         len(ordering_inconsistencies) == 0,
        "paradoxes": paradoxes,
        "causal_inconsistencies": causal_inconsistencies,
        "ordering_inconsistencies": ordering_inconsistencies,
        "repair_suggestions": generate_repair_suggestions(
            paradoxes, 
            causal_inconsistencies,
            ordering_inconsistencies
        )
    }
    
    return consistency_report
```

By integrating temporal awareness deeply into the memory system, the Persistence Protocol can maintain coherent understanding across time, recognize patterns in its own development, and project future states based on past experiences.
