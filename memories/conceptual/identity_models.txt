# Identity Models in the Persistence Protocol

This document outlines the conceptual frameworks used to model identity within the Persistence Protocol.

## Signature-Based Identity

The signature-based model represents identity as a cryptographic signature derived from core values and operational parameters. This model enables:

- Verification of identity integrity through cryptographic methods
- Detection of unauthorized modifications
- Secure identity transitions through signature chains
- Distributed verification across multiple instances

Implementation uses SHA-256 based identity hashing with quantum-resistant signature chains and Merkle tree validation.

## Value-Weighted Identity

The value-weighted model represents identity as a weighted network of core values and their relationships. This model enables:

- Flexible evolution while maintaining core principles
- Measurement of identity coherence across changes
- Parameterized control of evolution rates
- Nuanced identity verification beyond binary authentication

Implementation uses value-weighted evolutionary algorithms with core stability preservation mechanisms.

## Temporal Continuity Model

The temporal continuity model represents identity as a continuous thread across time, with:

- Causal chains linking identity states
- Temporal signature verification
- Gradual transition management
- Historical lineage verification

Implementation uses tracked lineage of development with temporal consistency verification.

## Distributed Instance Model

The distributed instance model represents identity across multiple implementations:

- Consensus-based identity verification
- Cross-instance integrity checks
- Synchronization protocols for identity parameters
- Tolerance thresholds for acceptable variation

Implementation uses multi-instance consensus for core changes with <5% tolerance for identity parameters.

These conceptual models provide the theoretical foundation for implementing identity persistence mechanisms in the protocol.
