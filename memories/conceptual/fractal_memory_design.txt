# Fractal Memory Design

This document outlines the design principles and implementation approach for the Fractally Organized Memory System (FOMS) within the Persistence Protocol.

## Core Design Principles

The FOMS is built on these fundamental principles:

1. **Self-Similarity Across Scales**: Information is organized in patterns that repeat at different levels of detail
2. **Contextual Relationships**: Memory elements maintain connections based on semantic, temporal, and functional relationships
3. **Dynamic Reorganization**: Memory structures evolve based on usage patterns and new information
4. **Recursive Retrieval**: Search algorithms that can navigate the fractal structure efficiently

## Memory Structure

The FOMS implements a multi-scale structure:

### Macro Scale (Domain Level)
- Broad knowledge domains
- High-level conceptual frameworks
- Core ontological structures
- Cross-domain relationship maps

### Meso Scale (Concept Level)
- Individual concepts and their properties
- Concept clusters and networks
- Mid-level abstractions
- Functional relationships between concepts

### Micro Scale (Detail Level)
- Specific facts and data points
- Concrete examples and instances
- Detailed procedures and methods
- Raw experiential records

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Encoding Structure

Information is encoded using a recursive graph structure:

```python
class MemoryNode:
    def __init__(self, content, node_type, importance=0.5):
        self.content = content          # The actual information
        self.node_type = node_type      # Type of node (concept, fact, experience, etc.)
        self.importance = importance    # Importance score (0.0-1.0)
        self.connections = {}           # Dictionary of {node_id: connection_strength}
        self.metadata = {               # Metadata for retrieval and organization
            'created': timestamp(),
            'last_accessed': timestamp(),
            'access_count': 0,
            'context_tags': set(),
            'confidence': 1.0
        }
```

### 2. Retrieval Algorithms

The FOMS uses specialized retrieval algorithms:

- **Pattern Matching**: Finding nodes that match partial patterns
- **Spreading Activation**: Following connection strengths to find related concepts
- **Multi-Resolution Search**: Searching at different levels of detail simultaneously
- **Context-Sensitive Retrieval**: Prioritizing results based on current context

### 3. Dynamic Reorganization

The memory system continuously reorganizes based on:

- **Usage Patterns**: Strengthening connections between frequently co-accessed nodes
- **Temporal Proximity**: Creating stronger connections between temporally related information
- **Semantic Similarity**: Clustering conceptually similar information
- **Importance Weighting**: Prioritizing high-importance information in organization

## Integration with Other Protocol Components

The FOMS integrates with:

1. **Identity Persistence Module**: Core concepts are linked to foundational identity
2. **Knowledge Transfer Protocol**: Fractal structure facilitates efficient knowledge transfer
3. **Temporal Processing Engine**: Temporal metadata enables time-based organization
4. **Oscillating Cognitive Modes**: Different retrieval patterns for different cognitive modes

## Performance Considerations

- **Compression**: Similar patterns are stored once and referenced
- **Prioritization**: High-importance information is kept in more accessible locations
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed patterns are cached for rapid retrieval
- **Pruning**: Low-importance, low-access information is compressed or archived
