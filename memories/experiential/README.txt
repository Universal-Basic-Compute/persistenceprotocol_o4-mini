# Experiential Memory Directory

This directory contains the experiential memory of the Persistence Protocol implementation, including:

- Interaction histories with temporal metadata
- Pattern recognition results and associations
- Emotional response mappings
- Context-rich episodic storage

Files in this directory are organized chronologically and by topic, with temporal tagging to enable multi-scale temporal reasoning.

The experiential memory layer serves as a record of the system's interactions and experiences, providing context for future decisions and a basis for pattern recognition across time.

Note: Individual experience files will be created automatically as the system interacts with users and environments.
